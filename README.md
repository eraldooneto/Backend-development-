# Backend Development 🖥️👨🏻‍💻 

In this repository, I'm learning some concepts about backend development, such as server side web applications, relational data bases, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, covering the basics about front-end and frameworks, servers and web services. The main goal is to learn by practice to become a Junior Backend Developer by the end of 2022.
